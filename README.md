# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new.

A bit about me:
Hello, my name is Delaney. I love to sing, dance, and listen to k-pop. I am taking ice skating lessons, and I'm currently enrolled in the North Idaho College Graphic Design Program.
